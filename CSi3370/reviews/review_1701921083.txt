This is one of my favorite 991 Porsche 911 models, as it's simply stunning. It's a GT3 RS that's finished in an unusual (and head-turning!) color called Lizard Green, it touts relatively low mileage, AND it boasts the highly desirable Weissach Package. This GT3 RS also boasts some great equipment, including a front axle lift system, neat personalized door sill plates, and a Bose surround sound system. It's also nearly unmodified, and it touts a clean, accident-free Carfax report that exclusively lists registrations in warm-weather Texas for peace of mind. I'm proud to review this 911 GT3 RS on Auto Insights , and I'm already jealous of the next owner.
